# Face Mask Identification using PyTorch and CNN

ðŸ˜·

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a face mask identification system using PyTorch and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The objective is to detect whether a person in an image is wearing a face mask or not. By leveraging deep learning and computer vision techniques, this system can aid in scenarios such as monitoring compliance with face mask regulations, enhancing safety measures, and automating face mask detection tasks.

## Dataset

The face mask identification model is trained on a dataset consisting of images of people with and without face masks. The dataset includes two classes: "With Mask" and "Without Mask". Each image is appropriately labeled to facilitate supervised learning. Please ensure that you have the dataset available before proceeding with the project.you may refer this link for dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/face-mask-detection)

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3
- PyTorch
- TorchVision
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- tqdm
- scikit-learn

You can install the necessary packages by running the following command:
'''
pip install -r requirements.txt
'''


3. Prepare your dataset by organizing the images into appropriate directories. Create two folders: "With Mask" and "Without Mask". Place the corresponding images in their respective folders.

4. Train the face mask identification model:


5. Once the training is complete, you can use the trained model for face mask identification:


6. The output will indicate whether the person in the image is wearing a face mask or not.

## Results

Evaluate the performance of the face mask identification model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Provide details of the evaluation results and any additional insights gained from the model's performance.
